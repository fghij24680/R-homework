# R-homework

This is an R homework. The model aims to provide election suggestions for the Liberal Party (hypothetical) through the analysis of statistical data.

**Question 1.** 
Based on some information that we know about a person, can we predict how do they feel about the Liberal Party? The information includes the age, citizenship, gender, province, education level and how they are satisfied with the way democracy works.

**Question 2.** 
Does the age factor significantly influence how satisfied are people with the performance of the federal government?

**Question 3. **
Does the feeling about the immigrants significantly influence the first choice to vote for?
